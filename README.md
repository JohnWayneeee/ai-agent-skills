## 💡 Why Agent Skills?

Most AI agents know everything and do nothing well.

Skills fix that. Each one gives your agent a focused role, a clear process, and opinionated defaults — so instead of writing a 500-word prompt every time, you invoke a name and get expert-level output.

| Benefit | What it means |
|---------|--------------|
| ✅ **Consistent results** | Same inputs, same quality, every time |
| 👥 **Team-ready** | Share a skill folder and everyone's agent behaves the same way |
| 🔗 **Composable** | Chain skills together for multi-step workflows |
| 🚀 **Production-tested** | Built and validated on a real product, not theoretical |

## 📋 Skill Details

<details>
<summary><strong>ui-final-polish</strong> — Final visual polish without redesign</summary>

**Category:** Design
**Use when:** Structure is done, but spacing, hierarchy, or rhythm feel off.

Applies a systematic pass over an existing UI component or page — fixing alignment, type scale, colour contrast, and white space — without changing layout or functionality.

[→ View skill](skills/ui-final-polish/)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>react-flow-best-practices</strong> — @xyflow/react v12 patterns</summary>

**Category:** Development
**Use when:** Building or debugging a React Flow canvas, custom nodes, or edge routing.

Covers node registration, handle placement, custom node types, viewport management, and performance patterns for `@xyflow/react` v12.

[→ View skill](skills/react-flow-best-practices/)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>payoff-action-modeling</strong> — Post-outcome UI decisions</summary>

**Category:** Design
**Use when:** Deciding what UI actions to show after a user completes a key step.

Models the decision tree for post-outcome actions — placement, scope, urgency, and copy — based on what the user was trying to achieve.

[→ View skill](skills/payoff-action-modeling/)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>browser-audit</strong> — Pre-deploy quality check</summary>

**Category:** Quality
**Use when:** Before deploying any page to production.

Runs a structured audit covering accessibility (WCAG), SEO meta, Core Web Vitals readiness, and Lighthouse score targets — returning prioritised findings.

[→ View skill](skills/browser-audit/)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>workflow-node-setup</strong> — React Flow node configuration</summary>

**Category:** Development
**Use when:** A workflow node isn't connecting, resizing, or rendering correctly.

Covers handle registration, resize observer setup, drag-and-drop wiring, and markdown output rendering inside React Flow nodes.

[→ View skill](skills/workflow-node-setup/)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>pencil-to-code</strong> — Wireframe to production code</summary>

**Category:** Design
**Use when:** You have a Pencil `.pen` design and need production frontend code.

Reads Pencil design files and generates layout, typography, spacing, and component structure faithful to the original wireframe.

[→ View skill](skills/pencil-to-code/)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>figma-pencil-fsd-tailwind4</strong> — Design to FSD + Tailwind 4 code</summary>

**Category:** Design
**Use when:** Translating a Figma frame or Pencil `.pen` design into production code that respects Feature-Sliced Design boundaries and Tailwind v4 token conventions.

Framework-agnostic. Decomposes a design into `shared` / `entities` / `features` / `widgets` / `pages` / `app-shell` / `app` layers, reconciles design variables with semantic tokens, enforces Server/Client boundaries when the host framework has RSC, and validates against an accessibility checklist. Comes with 8 reference files covering FSD mapping, RSC boundaries, Tailwind v4 tokens, Figma MCP workflow, Pencil workflow, a11y, project contracts, and a worked frame-to-code example.
